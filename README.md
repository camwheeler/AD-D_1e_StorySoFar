# Preface: A New Contender Appears

## Setting the Scene
### Three years earlier
Vor, an unremarkable man in search of deeper meaning to life, has decided that a position in the priesthood of **Drá: The Uncaring** is just the thing he needs. As a young initiate, he finds himself on yet another dismal afternoon, rushing in the sweltering midday heat to a lesson he was already late for. In his haste, he fails to notice an aged ascetic, seemingly prostrate in obeisance.

Vor trips over the man, falling flat on top of him. While quickly trying to think of the best apology for such a situation, he realizes that the man has long since expired. While trying to extract himself from the precarious position, he inadvertently presses his hand to the man's holy symbol -- a pair of circles connected by a wavy line. Immediately upon touching the symbol, Vor feels a deep and meaningful connection that compels his mind to expand, and at last to comprehend...

He only awakens from his trance after others call for help and eventually someone shows up to help remove the body. He staggers away, clutching the holy symbol, his life forever changed.

### Three days earlier
Erik the Evil, the very evil, very dumb barbarian has recently made parole (though many would say it was, "just the excuse used to kick him out") from **Haverford Maximium Security Penetentiary** under the newly established **Barbarian Rehabilitation Program**. As part of the **Terms of Parole** the penetentiary is supposed to provide for constant supervision of the parolee, however as part of the terms of the rehabilitation program, the parole officer is to be _incognito and undiscolsed to the subject._

### Three hours earlier
_A thin rail of a man - probably more boy than man - bustles about his room gathering odds and ends, clearly preparing for a trip. His robes are obviously second (or third) hand, but are otherwise in good shape and he wears a scowl across his face._

"Demitri, don't forget a jar of visma paste. Demitri, I need another bunch of fesul... Another week and yet another trip to Haverford for _more_ ingredients," the young man says, speaking to nobody. "He sends me there so often I don't know why Thaumaturgist Grayson doesn't just move there. Or at least to a town with a bigger market. Then again, I'm the one that's going, so it's not like it matters to him." His scowl softens slightly as he pauses in his hasty packing and falls into deep thought.

`I should be grateful.  I came from nothing...less than nothing.  I grew up in the slums with the rats and thieves, but I got out.  By sheer luck and will, I got out.  Now I'm studying to become a mage.  I have to pay my dues, and there's nothing wrong with that.  But I'd rather be studying my books, and not making another trip to Haverford.` 

`Either way, I've heard the bandits along Kingsroad have only gotten worse.  I don't mind it so much.  It's not like I haven't been robbed before.  The real important things I hide.  The rest I give away without a second thought and Thaumaturgist Grayson can just live with hit.  All things being equal though, I'd prefer to avoid the hassle. `

### Present
Vor, cleric of Drá: the uncaring, singer of the hymns of the gods is sitting in the shade under the canted eaves of the local tannery, softly singing in quiet contemplation. He spies a very large, very brutish looking fellow heading toward the tavern across the street and hits a horribly discordant note. A vision of the brute solidifies in his mind. `Something is out of tune in the flow, and he is at the heart of it. Seems like another calling has been extended.` Vor immediately begins following the barbarian.

Erik the Evil's keen senses trigger immediately as the man at the tannery rises.

`Him following?    ...    Yes. Him following.`

`Spy?    ...    Yes. Them send another.`

`Kill more?    ...    No, them jsut send more.`

`Ohhhh! I trick him. Maybe I let funny man follow me? Orrrr, maybe I follow funny smelly man!`

Entering the bar, Erik sidles on up to the bartender, "Two beers!"

Following him inside, Vor finds the great barbarian already seated, with two frothy mugs in front of him. The man is signaling Vor to come over and gestures to the empty seat on his left. As he approaches, the giant of a man speaks in a thunderous tone, "Errr, blessed be him what gives the chieftain his fair share!" 

The barbarian raises his own mug in a toast, and slides the second across the oaken surface of the bar. Confused, Vor picks it up and takes a small sip. `Ahhh, like an old, long forgotten friend...` And then another, and then drains it, slumping over across the bar as he finishes -- his diet of begged rice over the past three years failing to prepare him for a decent brew.

_Sitting quietly in a corner booth concealed by shadows, a slim elf watches the exchange._

`Not the big guy. Not the big guy. Just focus on the drunks, like that human slumped against the bar. The big one will draw too much attention...`

_Unnoticed by the other patrons, she slips out of her shadowy booth and works her way toward her mark._

Erik looks about and realizes everyone in the tavern is staring at him next to the slumped over Vor at the bar. Fear sinks in deep as this could land him back in "reeducation". While Erik struggles to think, which is difficult for him on the best of days, the bartender notices the man slumped over at _his_ bar and snaps him with his bar towel, "You're not allowed to sleep in here, they'll pull my license. This is a reputable establishment." 

_A few coins and an intricate signet ring later she just manages to get her hand out of his pockets before the bartender's actions return the man, briefly, to his senses._

`Well that was close. And... since I'm already over here and everyone is distracted, maybe I can grab something from the big guy while I'm at it.`

_Kiki slips over behind the brute, oblivious to the conversation happening around her, and eases her fingers into his pockets_

Turning to Erik, the bartender adds, "So get your friend here and leave. I shouldn't have served your kind to begin with."

_The dog has insulted Erik. His faces burns red as the blood rises to the challenge, His last point of intelligence screaming `TRAP!` before giving out. Meanwhile, Vor begins humming a song in an odd mode and meter and has another sip oblivious to the danger around him._

Erik bursts to his feet, not even noticing as Kiki is physically lifted off the floor, her arm caught in his clothing.

`Quick, how do I play this off!?` Kiki wonders, adrenaline beginning to make it hard to think clearly.

"There, there, big guy," she says in a gentle tone as she removes her empty hand from an empty pocket - `how was he going to pay for his drinks anyway?` - and pats him on his chest. "Surely this one isn't worht it... Maybe I can buy you another round?"

The bartender turns on her, incredulity in his angry eyes, "I already said **OUT**, that means you too little whelp!"

_Skulking in the shadows near the bar, Avi watches as Kiki's plan goes into action. She waits for her signal, watching as Kiki foolishly attempts to pick the big brutish fellow's pocket - `That wasn't part of the plan!` -, she realizes things are going awry, and after seeing the rude behavior of the barkeep, decides to make an exit._

`To hell with the plan. Again. I'm not allowing this establishment to get any of **my** hard earned money.`

_Avi skillfully slips over behind the bar, the shadow of a shadow. While the bartender is firmly distracted by the scene she quietly liberates a pouch of gold coin and makes her way out into the street, none the wiser._

> Note: There can be plenty more action at this juncture. Feel free to add a brawl scene or extra flavor to help us understand Erik better.

A few minutes, and a lot of noise later Vor, Erik, and Kiki emerge into the chill night air. Avi motions to Kiki to join her, "Hey sis! Over here! I got a decent haul while you had them, er, distracted. Should make up for any..." Avi glances back at the other two, "... shortcomings we may have had from the original plan."

Kiki runs her fingers along the face of her new signet ring in her pocket, noting the intricate and unfamiliar design. _She feels both a strong connection to the ring, a fact she doesn't want to share with her sister, and an impulsive urge to blow this town and get some fresh air. 

`We're marked as trouble here already anyway.`

"Why don't we take a trip south toward Haverford," she blurts out.

`Why in the world did I just say that?`

Attempting to clarify the remark for her sister, she adds, "I hear it's full of easy marks."

Vor, having caught up to the sisters and overhearing that last remark, decides to add himself to what was obviously a personal conversation, "Sure. Sounds like a plan. What's a mark?"

Avi and Kiki exchange a knowing glance, _we're totally going to have to ditch these guys._

> Note: From the little that I've seen from Vor so far, this seems like the tack he would take. Kind of rambling on without really providing a lot of useful information. If this isn't the vision you had for him, then it can be something more concise.
 
Vor continues, "Haverford is a good three days journey south from here. Ah, by foot, that is. Following the King's Road. It really is the only road that makes sense from here. If we start now we can make plenty of good progress before full dark sets in."

Demitri happens to be crossing the street at just this moment, on his way to the tavern to fill his wineskin before heading toward Haverford.

`Did they just say Haverford? That mountain of a man looks like he could handle a few rag tag bandits! Even if he may not be much for conversation. With two beautiful women as a bonus, this could work! Maybe I can convince them to let me tag along.`

Erik is confused. He was drinking and fighting... and now he has to walk for days to another city? Is he even a part of this group? When did that happen?

`At least funny smelly man is distracted by tiny girl. Girls? One, two... Huh.`

Erik's eyes glaze over at the mention of Haverford. He slips into a living memory of past events. _A strange man that couldn't get his name right. A beautiful woman. Climbing into bed with her to find that she had six legs! And Fangs! Strange man must pay!_ Blood pumping, the rage rising as his muscles begin to bulge. Erik comes to in a sweaty panic.

`Tiny girls know something. What they know? How they know it?`

Erik's eyes narrow as he studies Avi and Kiki more closely. They are all looking at him, as if awaiting the answer to a question he never heard. "Hrmp!" He says, and it seems to suffice.

`Haverford! That's where I know the name from!` Thinks Avi. `The bounty board in the thieves guild -- raiders on Kingsroad have been interrupting that trade route, a route that the Kingfishers have exclusive paid access to. It's making the thieves guild look bad. There is a 500gp bounty to anyone who can stop the rogue raiders. Maybe this brute of a man glaring at me can be put to some use. Just lead him to where the raiders have been besieging caravans and let nature take it's course.`

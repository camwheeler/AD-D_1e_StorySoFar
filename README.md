# Preface: A New Contender Appears

## Setting the Scene
### Three years earlier
Vor, an unremarkable man in search of deeper meaning to life, has decided that a position in the priesthood of **Drá: The Uncaring** is just the thing he needs. As a young initiate, he finds himself on yet another dismal afternoon, rushing in the sweltering midday heat to a lesson he was already late for. In his haste, he fails to notice an aged ascetic, seemingly prostrate in obeisance.

Vor trips over the man, falling flat on top of him. While quickly trying to think of the best apology for such a situation, he realizes that the man has long since expired. While trying to extract himself from the precarious position, he inadvertently presses his hand to the man's holy symbol -- a pair of circles connected by a wavy line. Immediately upon touching the symbol, Vor feels a deep and meaningful connection that compels his mind to expand, and at last to comprehend...

He only awakens from his trance after others call for help and eventually someone shows up to help remove the body. He staggers away, clutching the holy symbol, his life forever changed.

### Three days earlier
Erik the Evil, the very evil, very dumb barbarian has recently met parole (though many would say it was, "just the excuse needed to kick him out") from **Haverford Maximium Security Penetentiary** under the newly established **Barbarian Rehabilitation Program**.

### Present day
Vor, cleric of Drá: the uncaring, singer of the hymns of the gods is sitting in the shade under the canted eaves of the local tannery, softly singing in quiet contemplation. He spies a very large, very brutish looking fellow heading toward the tavern across the street and hits a horribly discordant note. A vision of the brute solidifies in his mind. `Something is out of tune in the flow, and he is at the heart of it. Seems like another calling has been extended.` Vor immediately begins following the barbarian.

Erik the Evil's keen senses trigger immediately as the man at the tannery rises.

`Him following?    ...    Yes. Him following.`

`Spy?    ...    Yes. Them send another.`

`Kill more?    ...    No, them jsut send more.`

`Ohhhh! I trick him. Maybe I let funny man follow me? Orrrr, maybe I follow funny smelly man!`

Entering the bar, Erik sidles on up to the bartender, "Two beers!"

Following him inside, Vor finds the great barbarian already seated, with two frothy mugs in front of him. The man is signaling Vor to come over and gestures to the empty seat on his left. As he approaches, the giant of a man speaks in a thunderous tone, "Errr, blessed be him what gives the chieftain his fair share!" 

The barbarian raises his own mug in a toast, and slides the second across the oaken surface of the bar. Confused, Vor picks it up and takes a small sip. `Ahhh, like an old, long forgotten friend...` And then another, and then drains it, slumping over across the bar as he finishes.

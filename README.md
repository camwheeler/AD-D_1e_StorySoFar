# Preface: A New Contender Appears

## Setting the Scene
### Three years earlier
Vor, an unremarkable man in search of deeper meaning to life, has decided that a position in the priesthood of **Drá: The Uncaring** is just the thing he needs. As a young initiate, he finds himself on yet another dismal afternoon, rushing in the sweltering midday heat to a lesson he was already late for. In his haste, he fails to notice an aged ascetic, seemingly prostrate in obeisance.

Vor trips over the man, falling flat on top of him. While quickly trying to think of the best apology for such a situation, he realizes that the man has long since expired. While trying to extract himself from the precarious position, he inadvertently presses his hand to the man's holy symbol -- a pair of circles connected by a wavy line. Immediately upon touching the symbol, Vor feels a deep and meaningful connection that compels his mind to expand, and at last to comprehend...

He only awakens from his trance after others call for help and eventually someone shows up to help remove the body. He staggers away, clutching the holy symbol, his life forever changed.

### Three days earlier
Erik the Evil, the very evil, very dumb barbarian has recently made parole (though many would say it was, "just the excuse used to kick him out") from **Haverford Maximium Security Penetentiary** under the newly established **Barbarian Rehabilitation Program**. As part of the **Terms of Parole** the penetentiary is supposed to provide for constant supervision of the parolee, however as part of the terms of the rehabilitation program, the parole officer is to be _incognito and undiscolsed to the subject._

### Present day
Vor, cleric of Drá: the uncaring, singer of the hymns of the gods is sitting in the shade under the canted eaves of the local tannery, softly singing in quiet contemplation. He spies a very large, very brutish looking fellow heading toward the tavern across the street and hits a horribly discordant note. A vision of the brute solidifies in his mind. `Something is out of tune in the flow, and he is at the heart of it. Seems like another calling has been extended.` Vor immediately begins following the barbarian.

Erik the Evil's keen senses trigger immediately as the man at the tannery rises.

`Him following?    ...    Yes. Him following.`

`Spy?    ...    Yes. Them send another.`

`Kill more?    ...    No, them jsut send more.`

`Ohhhh! I trick him. Maybe I let funny man follow me? Orrrr, maybe I follow funny smelly man!`

Entering the bar, Erik sidles on up to the bartender, "Two beers!"

Following him inside, Vor finds the great barbarian already seated, with two frothy mugs in front of him. The man is signaling Vor to come over and gestures to the empty seat on his left. As he approaches, the giant of a man speaks in a thunderous tone, "Errr, blessed be him what gives the chieftain his fair share!" 

The barbarian raises his own mug in a toast, and slides the second across the oaken surface of the bar. Confused, Vor picks it up and takes a small sip. `Ahhh, like an old, long forgotten friend...` And then another, and then drains it, slumping over across the bar as he finishes -- his diet of begged rice over the past three years failing to prepare him for a decent brew.

_Sitting quietly in a corner booth concealed by shadows, a slim elf watches the exchange._

`Not the big guy. Not the big guy. Just focus on the drunks, like that human slumped against the bar. The big one will draw too much attention...`

_Unnoticed by the other patrons, she slips out of her shadowy booth and works her way toward her mark._

Erik looks about and realizes everyone in the tavern is staring at him next to the slumped over Vor at the bar. Fear sinks in deep as this could land him back in "reeducation". While Erik struggles to think, which is difficult for him on the best of days, the bartender notices the man slumped over at _his_ bar and snaps him with his bar towel, "You're not allowed to sleep in here, they'll pull my license. This is a reputable establishment." 

_A few coins and an intricate signet ring later she just manages to get her hand out of his pockets before the bartender's actions return the man, briefly, to his senses._

`Well that was close. And... since I'm already over here and everyone is distracted, maybe I can grab something from the big guy while I'm at it.`

_Kiki slips over behind the brute, oblivious to the conversation happening around her, and eases her fingers into his pockets_

Turning to Erik, the bartender adds, "So get your friend here and leave. I shouldn't have served your kind to begin with."

_The dog has insulted Erik. His faces burns red as the blood rises to the challenge, His last point of intelligence screaming `TRAP!` before giving out. Meanwhile, Vor begins humming a song in an odd mode and meter and has another sip oblivious to the danger around him._

Erik bursts to his feet, not even noticing as Kiki is physically lifted off the floor, her arm caught in his clothing.

`Quick, how do I play this off!?` Kiki wonders, adrenaline beginning to make it hard to think clearly.

"There, there, big guy," she says in a gentle tone as she removes her empty hand from an empty pocket `how was he going to pay for his drinks anyway?` and pats him on his chest. "Surely this one isn't worht it... Maybe I can buy you another round?"

The bartender turns on her, incredulity in his angry eyes, "I already said **OUT**, that means you too little whelp!"
